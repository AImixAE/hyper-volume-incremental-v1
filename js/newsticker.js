 actually 2<sup>53</sup>-1 and 2<sup>1024</sup>-2<sup>971</sup>. This is because if it exceeds 2<sup>53</sup>, there
  will only be even numbers, so 2<sup>53</sup>+1=2<sup>53</sup> will appear, and 2<sup>53</sup>+1=2<sup>53</sup> is 
  obviously wrong. But one thing to note is that this is the largest safe integer that can be represented by a 
  double-precision floating point number. It is different in \"single\" precision floating point numbers. The largest 
  safe integer and the largest representable number of single-precision floating-point numbers are 2<sup>24</sup>-1 and 
  2<sup>128</sup>. Using single-precision floating-point numbers will also result in situations like 
  2<sup>24</sup>+1=2<sup>24</sup>. However, there are two other ways to represent integers: int and long. int (unsigned) 
  can represent numbers as large as 4294967295 (2<sup>32</sup>-1), while long (unsigned) can represent numbers as large
   as 18446744073709551616 (2<sup>64</sup>-1). These two types have no error, but the disadvantage is that the numbers
    they can represent are also very small. However, some games have exceeded the upper limit of 1e308: Antimatter 
    Dimensions, Incremental Mass Rewritten...<del>etc.</del>. But the upper limits of the numbers represented by these 
    games are different. The upper limit of the antimatter dimension number is 1.000e9.000e15 (to be more precise, it is 
    1.000e9.007e15); the theorical upper limit of the Incremental Mass Rewritten is F1.797e308(10^^1.797e308); the largest,
     the Endless Stairwell has a maximum limit of K1e14, which is larger than the Graham's number (~3K64), which is really 
     incredible!`
